INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Change parameters in the "new Test(...)" contructor method call in Main.java.
1.1 new Test(nodes, links, table, ac, 250, 15, true) will initialize 15 signals per node during each time step and a true boolean will call for the use of defragmentation during simulation.
2. Upon completion of the simulation, data will be written to .xls files.
2.1 Simulations using defrag will output success rate data to "successes.xls".
2.2 Simulations not using defrag will output succes rate data to "normalSuccesses.xls".
2.3 Data regarding the state of network-wide fragmentation at moments before and after defragmentation, are output to "initialPlot.xls" and "finalPlot.xls".
    This data (the LinkTable) is displayed in tabulated form in "initial.xls" and "final.xls" respectively. A graphic plot is also created in "plot.xls".
Additional Notes:
1. Traffic increase amounts and the timestep at which they occur may be changed in Test.java
2. Network simulator details are loaded from "network.txt" or "network14,txt". This may be set in RoutingTable.java
3. Genetic Algorithm parameters may be changed in the GeneticAlgorithm.java, Mutator.java, Crosser.java and Selector.java classes.
SDK and API required:
1. Java 1.8 SDK
2. Microsoft Excel 1997 or later.
3. JXL API
